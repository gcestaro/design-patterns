# Behavioral Design Patterns

## Chain of Responsibility

Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain
of handlers. Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to
pass it to the next handler in the chain.

## Command

Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object that contains
all information about the request. This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments,
delay or queue a requestâ€™s execution, and support undoable operations.

exposing its underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).

## Mediator

Mediator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects. 
The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only 
via a mediator object.
