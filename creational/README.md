# Creational Design Patterns

## Factory Method

Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects 
in a superclass, but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

### Real life example

As a lawyer, you might want to generate different types of contracts for each of your clients based 
on the case, the client, etc.

## Abstract Factory

Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects 
without specifying their concrete classes.

### Real life example

## Builder

Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. 
The pattern allows you to produce different types and representations of an object using the same 
construction code.

### Real life example

The construction of a building is complex and has lots of rules involved.

## Prototype

Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your 
code dependent on their classes.

### Real life example

A closer analogy to the pattern is the process of mitotic cell division (biology, remember?). 
After mitotic division, a pair of identical cells is formed. The original cell acts as a prototype 
and takes an active role in creating the copy.

## Singleton

Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, 
while providing a global access point to this instance.

### Real life example

Earth is an example. There's just one instance of this Planet, at least that we know.
